# Random-Maze
This project initializes a **random maze** of size n and finds the path between two points in the maze. In this particular code, I utilized the endpoints (1,n) and (n,1) to test if the code acted appropriately.

## How it was planned
  <details>
  <summary> Initializing the Maze </summary>
  Before we can complete a maze, we must have a maze. Thus the first part of this project is dedicated to <strong> initializng the maze </strong>.
  This is done by randomly choosing whether two cells of a nxn matrix will have a horizontal "wall" and a vertical "wall". Simple for-loops, recursion, and understanding of matricies are utilized in this part of the project.

  <details>
    <summary> Finding the Path </summary>
   What good is having a maze if there's no path to follow? This part of the project is focused on simulating a path from one point in the maze to another. In this particular project, we are finding the path from the endpoints (1,n) to (n,1). Recursion, for-loops, conditionals, and understanding of array functions where used in this part of the project.
